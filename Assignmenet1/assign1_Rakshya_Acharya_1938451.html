        <p id="t1"> 
            Welcome to our cafeteri, and meet the owner Rakshya Acharya, 
            The creative mind behind the every tasty food. 
            With a passion for food and a commitment to providing nourishing meals to students, 
            Rakshya has been at the Rakshya's Kitchen of the cafeteria for over 5 years. 
            Rakshya's love for cooking started when she was young, watching her mother make delicious meals. 
            She decided to learn more about cooking by going to cooking school and working in different kitchens.
            Eventually, she realized she wanted to work in a place where she could cook for students, which led her to run the college cafeteria.
            Besides being great at cooking, Rakshya cares a lot about the environment.
            She likes to use ingredients from nearby farms and wants to help reduce the cafeteria's impact on the environment
            by doing things like using less plastic and wasting less food.
